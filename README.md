# credit-formatter
This React-based web app allows users to easily format credits from sources like Spotify. It takes a string of concatenated names (such as Spotify artist credits) and formats them by splitting the names based on capitalization patterns. Still in the process of being optimized! 

# This app is easy to use and designed with future scalability in mind. 

## Features
- **Input Parsing**: Users can input a string of credits, and the app will format it into a readable format.
- **Automatic Name Splitting**: The app intelligently splits names based on capital letters and spaces.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Material-UI, the interface is sleek, modern, and mobile-friendly.

## Future Features
- Optimized formatting and error identification.
- Refactor for use with other matching process tools.
- Add support for additional input formats and sources.
- Data validation for input names?
- Potential API Integration with DSPs like Spotify and Apple Music.
